It would be much easier to help you if we could see (parts) of your code!
Try reproducing your issue on one of these sites, save and then link it here:

<https://codepen.io/> - :warning: requires account
https://codesandbox.io/
<https://repl.it/>
<https://ideone.com/>
<https://jsfiddle.net/>

Sometimes trying to recreate a problem outside of your project already helps you tracking down the issue on your own.
